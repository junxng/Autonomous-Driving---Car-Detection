Autonomous Driving - Car Detection

Welcome to the programming assignment! In this notebook, you'll implement object detection using the very powerful YOLO model. Many of the ideas in this notebook are described in the two YOLO papers: Redmon et al., 2016 and Redmon and Farhadi, 2016.

By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to:

Detect objects in a car detection dataset
Implement non-max suppression to increase accuracy
Implement intersection over union
Handle bounding boxes, a type of image annotation popular in deep learning
